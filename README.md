# What is Outer-baste?

Outer-baste is a project I'm working on to try and keep track of some data that I will be generating when I am cooking a turkey this weekend! I'm not doing anything fancy to cook it, just some butter, salt, and pepper.

What I really wanted was a way to visualize my data and share it with my friends who will be at a party with me. This project will serve as a landing point for taking a look at Outerbase and seeing some of the features that they offer.

## Preparing

To prepare for this journey, I needed to make sure that everything works! So feel free to go take a look at [the testing folder!](./testing/README.md)
